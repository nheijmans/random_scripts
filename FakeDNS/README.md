# FakeDNS
This script was found on the REMNUX distro and was written by Francisco Santos. A blog post about fake DNS apps can be found on https://zeltser.com/fake-dns-tools-for-malware-analysis/

and the original recipe on http://code.activestate.com/recipes/491264-mini-fake-dns-server/

## What is it
A minimal python DNS server that replies with a configurable IP in an A record

## Changes made
Renamed variables to English for easier understanding the code. That's it :)

## Examples
```
python fakedns.py
```
